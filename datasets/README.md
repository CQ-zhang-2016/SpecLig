# Datasets

We trained/tested SpecLig using the same peptide and small molecule data sets as [UniMoMo](https://github.com/kxz18/UniMoMo) model.

You could process the data from scratch following their instructions, or directly download the preprocessed data (include the small-molecule augmented data) using our provided link.

1. Download the dataset from [this link](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/a3fe51195e7d44f4935e/).
2. Extract the TAR archive using the command: `tar -xzvf dataset.tar.gz`.
